# ORP_analysis
This is the README file for the ORP (Occurrence Ratio Profile) analysis.

ORP_02-11.R is the script to run.
The CSV files (Griesbachian, Dienerian, Smithian and Spathian) are incidence matrices from Brayard et al. 2006 (Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology). They are used as examples to reproduce Brayard et al's results

DISCLAIMERS:
 - You need to set your own working directory to run the code.
 - There is a typo in Brayard et al 2006. To reproduce their ORPs, you need to put "right=FALSE" in all hist functions.
